# [1.2.0]

## Enhancements
- Added multi-level debug
- Improved log readability and formatting
- Improved plugin detection

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed VST3 plugins incorrectly showing as missing in logs

## Known Issues
- Projects saved in older versions of Ableton Live seem to have different XML schemas, which will likely cause conversion errors or project corruption -- I'm looking into handling this automatically in future versions. For now, see the [Usage](https://github.com/glaurossi/Ableton-Plugin-Fixer#installation) section for the workaround.
